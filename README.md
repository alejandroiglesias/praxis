Praxis
------

Praxis is a modular CSS framework built on top of the large and robust [Axis](http://axis.netlify.com/) CSS utility library and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/).

**Note:** This project is in early development, and versioning is a little different. [Read this](http://markup.im/#q4_cRZ1Q) for more details.

### Installation

You can install Praxis through npm, as such:

```
npm install praxis --save
```

### Documentation

TODO.

### Browser Prefixing

Praxis does not include any cross-browser code at all, only pure CSS 3 as defined by the official spec. If you want your code to work better across browsers, we would recommend that you use [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), a library that is extraordinarily good at ensuring your CSS works correctly in the range of browsers you need it to.
